## Project Title: Predicting House Values Using Machine Learning

In this project, we aim to develop a predictive model for estimating house values using three distinct machine learning algorithms. By leveraging a housing dataset from Kaggle, we implement, train, and evaluate the performance of the following models:

1. Linear Regression
2. Decision Tree Regressor
3. Random Forest Regressor

### Project Workflow

The project follows a systematic approach, ensuring thorough data preparation and robust model evaluation:

1. Data Acquisition  
   We sourced the housing dataset from Kaggle, which contains various features related to house prices, including location, size, age, and more.

2. Data Preparation  
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): An in-depth analysis was conducted to understand the data distribution, relationships between variables, and potential outliers.
   - Feature Selection: Relevant features were selected based on their correlation with the target variable (house price).
   - Data Cleaning: The dataset was cleaned by handling inconsistencies and ensuring that all features were in a usable format.

3. Handling Missing Data 
   - Imputation: Missing values in the dataset were addressed using appropriate imputation techniques. Numerical features were imputed with the median, while categorical features were imputed with the most frequent value.
   - Verification: Post-imputation, the dataset was checked for any remaining missing values to ensure completeness.

4. Data Scaling  
   - Normalization: Feature scaling was applied to the numerical variables to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model training process. This was done using techniques like Min-Max Scaling or Standardization, depending on the model's requirement.

5. Model Training and Evaluation 
   - Training: The cleaned and prepared dataset was split into training and testing sets. Each of the three models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor) was trained on the training set.
   - Evaluation: The performance of the models was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) on the test set. This helped in understanding the predictive accuracy and robustness of each model.
   - Model Comparison: A comparison was made among the models to identify the best-performing algorithm based on the evaluation metrics.

### Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrates the application of multiple machine learning algorithms to predict house values. Each model's performance was critically analyzed, providing insights into their strengths and limitations in real-world scenarios.
